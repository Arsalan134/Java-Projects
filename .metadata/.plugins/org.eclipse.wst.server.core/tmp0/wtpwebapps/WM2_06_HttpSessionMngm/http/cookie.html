	<p>Cookies are small piece of information that is sent by web
		server in response header and gets stored in the browser cookies. When
		client make further request, it adds the cookie to the request header
		and we can utilize it to keep track of the session. We can maintain a
		session with cookies but if the client disables the cookies, then it
		won’t work.</p>
	<ol>
		Cookies we can classified two types
		<li>InMemory Cookies</li> The cookies that allocate memory on the
		browser window are called inmemory cookies. This cookies will be
		destroyed automatically once browser window is closed.
		<li>Persistent Cookies</li> The cookies allocate memory on the client
		machine file system(in the form of files) are called persistence
		cookies. These persistent cookies will not be destroyed browser window
		is closed.
	</ol>


	<pre>
		<p>
		To create Cookie
		================== 
		Cookie(String,String) 
		Cookie	ck1=new Cookie("uname","raja"); 
	 	Cookie ck2=new Cookie("id","2900");

		Note: Default age of the cookie -1 
		
		ck2.setMaxAge(3600); //sec
		
		HTTP protocol uses set-cookie response headers to send the cookie to the browser or
		client client machine along with the response.

		resp.addCookie(ck1);
		resp.addCookie(ck2); 
		
		
		To delete Cookies
		====================== 
		We cannot not delete cookies from server side programs bcz they allocated memory at 
		client side In memory cookies will be destroyed when browser window is closed. 
		Persistent cookies will be destroyed when expiry time completes. 
		
		To maxage =========
		ck1.getMaxAge();//-1 
		ck2.getMaxAge();//3600 
		
		
		For setting and getting comments
		================================== 
		ck1.setComment("user name related comment"); 
		String s=ck1.getComment(); 
		
		The filename will be username@waname[No] 
		
		Disadvantages ================== 
		Allowes only text values doesnot allow java objects as values. persistent cookie 
		doesn't have secracy cookies can be restricted coming to the browser.</p> </pre>
