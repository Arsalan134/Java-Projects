<title>Hidden Form Fields - Page1</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>We can create a unique hidden field in the HTML and when user
		starts navigating, we can set its value unique to the user and keep
		track of the session. This method can't be used with links because it
		needs the form to be submitted every time request is made from client
		to server with the hidden field. Also it's not secure because we can
		get the hidden field value from the HTML source and use it to hack the
		session.</p>
	<p>The disadvantage of using the hidden tags is that it only allows
		to preserve String values (or TextValues). It does NOT allow Java
		Objects as values.</p>

	<h2>Let's Test it out!</h2>
	
	<form action="../hidden1" method="get">
		Employee Name <input type="text" name="e_name"> <BR>
		Employee ID <input type="number" name="e_id"> <br> <br>
		<br> After filling this form submit this form by clicking Next,
		then continue filling second form. <br> <br> <input
			type="submit" value="Next">
	</form>
