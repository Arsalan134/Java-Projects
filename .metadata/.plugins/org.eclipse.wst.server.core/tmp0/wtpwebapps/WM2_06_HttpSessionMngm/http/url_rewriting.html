<title>URL-Rewriting</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>As we saw in last section that we can manage a session with HttpSession but if we 
	disable the cookies in browser, it won't work because server will not receive the cookies from client.
	Servlet API provides support for URL rewriting that we can use to manage session in this case.</p>
	<p>The best part is that from coding point of view, it's very easy to use and involves one 
	step - encoding the URL. Another good thing with Servlet URL Encoding is that it's a 
	fallback approach and it kicks in only if browser cookies are disabled.</p>
	<p>We can encode URL with HttpServletResponse <code>encodeURL()</code> method and if we 
	have to redirect the request to another resource and we want to provide session information, 
	we can use <code>encodeRedirectURL()</code> method.</p>

	<form action="../URL1" method="get">
		Name <input type="text"  name="name"> <BR>
		Father name <input type="text" name="fname"> <br> <br>
		<br> After filling this form submit this form by clicking Next,
		then continue filling second form.
		<br><br> 
		<input type="submit" value="Next">
	</form>
